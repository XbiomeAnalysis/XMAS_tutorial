# Principals of Differential Analysis methods

[@nearing2022microbiome] has showed that the multiple DA methods have different performances on microbiota (16s). Here, we integrated the its methods' part and our own understandings to give a draft whole picture for users who using DA of XMAS2. 


Microbiota data have the following characteristics:

1. **Compositional**: Mathematically, a data is defined as compositional, if it contains D multiple parts of nonnegative numbers whose sum is 1 or any constant-sum constraint. It can be formally stated as:

$$S^{D} = \left \{ X = [x_{1}, x_{2}, ..., x_{D}] | x_{i} > 0, i = 1, 2, ..., D; \sum^{D}_{i=1} x_{i} = K \right \}$$


2. **Over-Dispersed**: The variance are generally greater than the mean. There are several possible causes of overdispersion: correlated taxa counts, clustering of subjects, and within group heterogeneity. Negative Binomial Model addresses overdispersion by by explicitly modeling the correlated and sparse events via a latent variable.


3. **Sparsity**: Microbiome data typically is overdispersed and sparse with many zeros. When the number of zeros is excess than the standard distributions (e.g., normal, Poisson, binomial, NB, beta or gamma) can be readily fit, the data set is considered as â€˜zero inflate.

## RAIDA

RAIDA is from [@sohn2015robust]

### Vignette

[A robust approach for identifying differentially abundant features in metagenomic samples: RAIDA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4495302/)

### Input Data Type

All the input data type should be **Raw Counts**:

1. 16s rRNA sequencing (amplicon sequencing); 

2. Metagenomic sequencing (absolute abundance);

3. RNA-seq.

### Input Key Arguments

1. **c.data**: a data frame containing counts for both conditions.

2. **n.lib**: a vector containing the numbers of samples for both conditions.

### Procedures

**Approach for Identifying Differential Abundance (RAIDA)** - is a robust approach for identifying differentially abundant features in metagenomic samples across different conditions. It utilizes the ratio between features in a modified zero-inflated log-normal model.

1. Utilizing the ratios between the counts of features in each sample, eliminating possible problems associated with counts on different scales within and between conditions;

2. To fit ratios with zeros by EM algorithm, using a modified ZIL (zero-inflated log normal: sparsity);

3. Constructing a moderated t-statistics for the log ratio of each feature $y_{ij}$ using the estimated mean $\mu$ and variance $r^2$ and obtain $P$ values for the null hypotheses for all features;

4. Adjust $P$ values using a multiple testing correction method

### Key output

1. **TaxaID**: taxa ID.

2. **AdjustedPvalue**: Adjusted Pvalue by `stats::p.adjust`.

3. **Occurrence (All/Groups)**: prevalence of taxa.


### Original Syntax

```R
raida(c.data, 
      n.lib, 
      show.ref.features = FALSE, 
      show.all.features = FALSE, 
      mtcm = "BH", 
      zsc = 0)
```


### XMAS2 Syntax

```R
raida_res <- RAIDA::raida(c.data = otu_tab_reorder,
                            n.lib = n.samples)
```


## Summary

1. The most commonly assumed data distribution was the negative binomial distribution (DESeq2, edgeR, omnibus, mbzinb). 

> No data transformations were performed for negative binomial methods, or metagenomeSeq methods, to try and bring the data to normality as non-normality of data is taken into account in their statistical models. 


2. The remaining parametric methods (ALDEx2 t-test, t-test, limma-voom) all used statistical tests that assumed a Gaussian distribution of the data, therefore, transformations were needed before analysis, which here included a log transform of some kind.


3. Three methods (ALDEx2 Wilcoxon, ANCOM-II, LEfSe) were considered non-parametric (assumes no underlying distribution of data) as they used statistical tests that transformed data to ranks.


4. Two of the four negative binomial methods (DESeq2, edgeR) calculated scaling factors for each sample to account for uneven sequence count. 

5. Cumulative sum scaling (CSS) was used for both metagenomeSeq and MaAsLin2. Total sum scaling (TSS; also referred to as relative abundance) was performed for LEfSe, and for method that did not have a built-in normalization function (t-test) as this strategy is commonly used in the literature. Log-ratio based transformations were used for ALDEx2 methods, ANCOM, and, in addition to TSS, were applied to methods without a built-in normalization function.


## Advantages and disadvantages

1. limma-voom, edgeR, Wilcoxon (CLR), and LEfSe output a high number of significant ASVs on average, while ALDEx2 and ANCOM-II tended to identify only a relatively small number of ASVs as significant;

2. limma-voom, edgeR, Wilcoxon (CLR), and LEfSe methods have been previously found to exhibit a high FDR, in contrast, ANCOM appropriately controls the FDR;

3. We can clearly recommend that users avoid using edgeR (a tool primarily intended for RNA-seq data) as well as LEfSe (without p-value correction) for conducting DA testing with 16S rRNA gene data.

4. Users should also be aware that limma voom and the Wilcoxon (CLR) approaches may perform poorly on unfiltered data that is highly sparse.

5. More generally, we recommend that users employ several methods and focus on significant features identified by most tools.
